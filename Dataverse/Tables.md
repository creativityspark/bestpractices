# Tables

Good practices for Dataverse Tables. 

# TAB-001

Naming rules:

1. The [*Snake Case*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) notation must be used in the Schema Name.
1. Avoid abbreviations on Display or Schema Name as much as possible.
1. Make sure the plural name is appropriate. 
1. If the Table represents a relationship or hierarchy, include the parent table name in the Display and Schema Name.
1. The *Display Name* must be unique in the Dataverse environment. 
1. If you need to use the same name of a System Table, rename the System Table with the OOTB (Out-of-the-box) prefix. 

## Rationale 

1. The Snake Case syntax facilitates the reading of the name, and is aligned with the underscore character used between the publisher prefix and the name. It makes clear that the name refers to a table in the c# or Type Script early bound generated code.
1. Abbreviations are not always understood by everybody.
1. Duplicated Display Names make it difficult to distinguish one from the other in Advanced Find, list of tables, solutions, etc.
1. Including the parent table in the Table name makes more obvious the purpose of the table. 
1. The Plural Name is auto generated by the application, and sometimes is not right.

## Examples

| Display Name               | Plural Name                | Schema Name                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Document                   | Documents                  | csp_documents                  |
| Customer Product           | Customer Products          | csp_customer_products          |
| Customer Product Documents | Customer Product Documents | csp_customer_product_documents |

# TAB-002

Avoid creating new custom tables to replace existing system tables. If you need to do it so, rename the system entity with the OOTB prefix.

## Rationale

1. Although the existing tables may not provide all the functionality required, it usually requires less effort to adapt it to your needs instead of creating it from scratch. 
1. Creating a table requires many other considerations that are often missed, like alternate keys, relationships, views, icons, etc. Using an Out-of-te-box table will save you from having to implement all those.

# TAB-003

Every entity must have an icon configured. 
The selected icon must be made available in .svg format as web resources in the solution.

There are many sites providing access to free svg icons. The ones below are just a suggestion.

## Rationale

Table icons are used in many places in the UI, and when they are not set, it gives a sense of unfinished or unpolished product. No matter how small your table is, is always recommended to add an icon, and it takes only a few minutes.
